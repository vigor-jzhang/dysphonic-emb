# Dysphonic Voice Embedding
In our paper, ***Robust Vocal Quality Feature Embeddings for Dysphonic Voice Detection***, we propose a deep learning framework for generating acoustic feature embeddings that are sensitive to vocal quality. For the task of distinguishing the dysphonic and healthy voices, our method not only achieves good in-corpus and cross-corpus classification accuracy, but also learns consistent voice embeddings across different corpora. The proposed model also shows good generalizability on the degraded in-corpus and cross-corpus datasets.
